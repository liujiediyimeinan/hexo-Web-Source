Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

```java
public class ContainerWithMostWater {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        if (height == null || height.length < 2) {
            return 0;
        }
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length - 1;
        int max = 0;
        while (left < right) {
            max = Math.max(max, (right - left) * Math.min(height[right], height[left]));
            if (height[left] > height[right]) {
                right--;
            } else {
                left++;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
