 Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.     
Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

### For example,

Consider the following matrix:
```
[
  [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
  [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
  [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
]
```
Given target = `5`, return `true`.

Given target = `20`, return `false`.

```java
public class SearchA2DMatrixII {

    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        int w = matrix[0].length;

        for (int[] arr : matrix) {
            if (arr[0] <= target && arr[w - 1] >= target && (Arrays.binarySearch(arr, target) >= 0)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
