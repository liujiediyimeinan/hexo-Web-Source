Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

### Example:
```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```

```java
public class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        char[] sa = s.toCharArray();
        char[] ta = t.toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(sa);
        Arrays.sort(ta);
        for (int i = 0; i < sa.length; i++) {
            if (ta[i] != sa[i]) {
                return ta[i];
            }
        }

        return ta[ta.length-1];
    }
}
```
