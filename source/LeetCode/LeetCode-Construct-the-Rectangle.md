For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:
```
1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
```
You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.

### Example:
```
Input: 4
Output: [2, 2]
Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1].
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.
```
#### Note:
1. The given area won't exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer
2. The web page's width and length you designed must be positive integers.

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] constructRectangle(int area) {
        if (area < 0) return new int[2];

        int x = (int) Math.sqrt(area);
        int[] result = new int[2];
        int a = 0;
        int b = 0;
        for (int i = x; i <= area; i++) {
            if (area % i == 0) {
                a = i;
                b = area / i;
                break;
            }
        }
        result[0] = Math.max(a, b);
        result[1] = Math.min(a, b);
        return result;
    }
}
```
